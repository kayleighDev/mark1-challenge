## 1 . Variant Breakdown & Strategic Approach

| Variant | Site | Type | Conversion Goal / Design Intent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Ramp.com | Headline Swap | **Refined Value Proposition:** Focused the hero text on "Control and Maximum Savings" to immediately capture B2B interest. |
| **B** | Ramp.com | How It Works Section | **Clarity/Trust:** Injected a clean, 3-step visualization (Plan | Spend | Save) to immediately break down a complex product into understandable steps. |
| **C (Creative)** | Ramp.com | Social Proof Banner | **Authority/Trust:** Implemented a non-intrusive, sticky banner at the top to leverage customer authority before the user scrolls. |
| **D** | MemoryAir | Replace Main Image | **Modernization:** Swapped the legacy hero image with a high-quality, abstract visual to immediately upgrade the site's aesthetic and professional feel. |
| **E (Hard)** | MemoryAir | Key Benefit Bullets | **Readability:** Injected a fully isolated, clean list of key benefits using distinct icons to ensure critical information is easily digestible despite the legacy site structure. |
| **F (Bonus)** | MemoryAir | **Floating Exit-Intent Bar** | **Exit Capture:** Implemented a fixed, high-contrast bar at the bottom of the viewport to capture leads who are about to leave the long sales page. |
